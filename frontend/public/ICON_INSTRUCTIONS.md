# PWA Icon Setup

Please save your JARVIS icon image as the following files in this directory:

1. **icon-192.png** - 192x192 pixels (for mobile home screen)
2. **icon-512.png** - 512x512 pixels (for high-res displays and splash screens)

The icon should be the circular JARVIS logo you uploaded with:
- "JARVIS" text at the top
- Robotic arms and server visualization in the center
- "By The Algorithm" text at the bottom
- Dark blue/cyan color scheme

## How to create the icons:

1. Save your original JARVIS image
2. Use an image editor (Photoshop, GIMP, or online tool like https://www.iloveimg.com/resize-image)
3. Resize to 192x192 and save as `icon-192.png`
4. Resize to 512x512 and save as `icon-512.png`
5. Place both files in `/home/user/JARVIS/frontend/public/`

Once added, the PWA will be fully functional and installable on mobile devices.
